abstract = {We present a comprehensive review of published results from the last 30 years regarding the sources and atmospheric characteristics of particles and ozone in the Metropolitan Area of S{\~{a}}o Paulo (MASP). During the last 30 years, many efforts have been made to describe the emissions sources and to analyse the primary and secondary formation of pollutants under a process of increasing urbanisation in the metropolitan area. From the occurrence of frequent violations of air quality standards in the 1970s and 1980s (due to the uncontrolled air pollution sources) to a substantial decrease in the concentrations of the primary pollutants, many regulations have been imposed and enforced, although those concentrations do not yet conform to the World Health Organization guidelines. The greatest challenge currently faced by the S{\~{a}}o Paulo State Environmental Protection Agency and the local community is controlling secondary pollutants such as ozone and fine particles. Understanding the formation of these secondary pollutants, by experimental or modelling approaches, requires the description of the atmospheric chemical processes driven by biofuel, ethanol and biodiesel emissions. Exposure to air pollution is the cause of many injuries to human health, according to many studies performed not only in the region but also worldwide, and affects susceptible populations such as children and the elderly. The MASP is the biggest megacity in the Southern Hemisphere, and its specifics are important for other urban areas that are facing the challenge of intensive growth that puts pressure on natural resources and worsens the living conditions in urban areas. This text discusses how imposing regulations on air quality and emission sources, mainly related to the transportation sector, has affected the evolution of pollutant concentrations in the MASP.},

abstract = {Objective. To assess the status of the legal framework for air quality control in all countries of Latin America and Caribbean (LAC); to determine the current distribution of air monitoring stations and mean levels of air pollutants in all capital and large cities (more than 100 000 inhabitants); and to discuss the implications for climate change and public policymaking. Methods. From January 2015-February 2016, searches were conducted of online databases for legislation, regulations, policies, and air pollution programs, as well as for the distribution of monitoring stations and the mean annual levels of air pollution in all LAC countries. Results. Only 117 cities distributed among 17 of 33 LAC countries had official information on ground level air pollutants, covering approximately 146 million inhabitants. The annual mean of inhalable particles concentration in most of the cities were over the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines; notably, only Bolivia, Peru, and Guatemala have actually adopted the guidelines. Most of the cities did not have information on particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less, and only a few measured black carbon. Conclusions. The air quality regulatory framework should be updated to reflect current knowledge on health effects. Monitoring and control of ground level pollutants should be extended and strengthened to increase awareness and protect public health. Using the co-benefits of air pollution control for health and climate as a framework for policy and decision-making in LAC is recommended.},

abstract = {openair is an R package primarily developed for the analysis of air pollution measurement data but which is also of more general use in the atmospheric sciences. The package consists of many tools for importing and manipulating data, and undertaking a wide range of analyses to enhance understanding of air pollution data. In this paper we consider the development of the package with the purpose of showing how air pollution data can be analysed in more insightful ways. Examples are provided of importing data from UK air pollution networks, source identification and characterisation using bivariate polar plots, quantitative trend estimates and the use of functions for model evaluation purposes. We demonstrate how air pollution data can be analysed quickly and efficiently and in an interactive way, freeing time to consider the problem at hand. One of the central themes of openair is the use of conditioning plots and analyses, which greatly enhance inference possibilities. Finally, some consideration is given to future developments. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry Model) is being used to perform air quality forecast over the southeast Brazil with a domain centered in the Metropolitan Area of S{\~{a}}o Paulo (MASP). The simulations are used to understand the pollutants behavior concerning the fluxes to and from the urban areas, to examine the formation of secondary pollutants (e.g., tropospheric ozone), and to validate the efficacy of air quality policies implementation, particularly the ones that are related to the vehicular fuel used in the region. One important factor to improve the air quality simulations is the configuration of suited inflow boundary conditions for the chemical species. In that context, the objective of this study is to assess the impacts of using time-dependent Chemical Lateral Boundary Conditions (CBC) on tropospheric ozone simulations with WRF-Chem. Two simulations were carried out using Carbon-Bond Mechanism version Z (CBMZ). The first simulation was a set-up to run with WRF-Chem default CBC, and the second one using time-dependent CBC obtained from MOZART-4 (Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers, version 4) simulations. The period of study was from May 15 to May 18 and from October 30 to November 1, 2006, when a comprehensive experiment with ozonesondes launching and surface measurements was performed. Results show that using MOZART-4 CBC reduced mean bias, RMSE and slightly improved correlation coefficients for ground level ozone as well as ozone vertical profile above 3 km. These improvements were more significant during periods with lower photochemical activity. However, underestimation of ozone concentration peaks was also observed in this period, which can be an issue for operational air quality forecasting.},
